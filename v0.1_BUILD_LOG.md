### Problems found while Assembly

* R10 and R18 looks quite similar on pcb (via below silkscreen)
* A bit more thermal spaces to the pad's would be useful
* switch is note easy to reach


## First tests of the prototype

### Step Down measurements

The only connection to the board was the Supply voltage connected to the SUPPLY connector.

V_in    | I_in      | TP 5V     | TP 3.3V
--------|-----------|-----------|--------
4.3V    | 2.1mA     | 4.0V      | 3.33V
5.0V    | 2.3mA     | 4.5V      | 3.33V
6.0V    | 2.2mA     | 4.5V      | 3.33V
7.0V    | 2.2mA     | 4.5V      | 3.33V
10.0V   | 1.9mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
12.0V   | 2.0mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
15.0V   | 2.2mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
20.0V   | 2.4mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
25.0V   | 2.6mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
30.0V   | 2.8mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
35.0V   | 3.1mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
40.0V   | 3.5mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
45.0V   | 3.8mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
48.0V   | 4.0mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V
50.0V   | 4.2mA     | 4.6V      | 3.33V

For now, all seems OK. Please note, The 5V Test Point does not actually reach 5V. According to my calculations,
a voltage between 4.47-4.62V is expected. This is due some design decisions, which result in lower part requirements.

Expected Voltage at TP 3.3V lies between 3.25-3.35, which Is also looks OK.

Note to myself: Also measure the voltage at A_IN

### Programming of Arduino Bootloader (25.03.2017)

I'm using an ```ARM-USB-OCD-H``` connected to board usin the ```ARM-JTAG-SWD``` adapter.
Furthermore, I connected the usb port to my computer, to power up the device.

Content of ```openocd_olimex.cfg```:

```
source [find interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-ocd-h.cfg]
source [find interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-jtag-swd.cfg]

set CHIPNAME at91samd21g18
set ENDIAN little

source [find target/at91samdXX.cfg]
```

#### upload bootloader using openocd

```
$ openocd -f openocd_olimex.cfg
```

Note: ``$HOME`` has to be replaced by actual path. Depending on library version, the path to the bootloader probably
also needs to be adjusted.

```
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 4444
> init
> halt
> at91samd bootloader 0
> program {{$HOME/.arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/samd/1.6.12/bootloaders/zero/samd21_sam_ba.bin}} verify reset
> shutdown
```

When programming finished sucessfully, the LED (D3) should start slowly blinking, indicating that the bootloader is running.


### Upload first example using Arduino IDE

* Select ```Arduino/Genuino Zero (Native USB Port)``` as Boad
* Load the Blink Example
* Select Port which is opened by bootloaders
* press upload and wait until console finished

Now the status LED (D3) should blinking as expected

### Test Board Peripherie

I build a little programm which run's the stepper motor in half step mode.

To specify a maximum current for the motor driver, it was required to rewrite ```analogWrite(uint32_t pin, uint32_t value)```
to use a prescaler of 1/4 instead of 1/256, otherwise the analog output voltage wouldn't be very stable.

After some coding, this is now working, and was able to run a stepper motor with about 120 RPM and active overcurrent protection
using this driver pcb, showing that the general electronic is working as expected.

As next step, I will test the other circuit parts like the analog inputs as well as the SPI Magnetic Rotary Position Sensor,
I2C temperatur sensor and the I2C EEPROM.

### Problems found while Testing

* Pin 2 <-> Pin 4 are swapped on the schematic (they are also swapped in the original arduino schematic, and I didn't spot that)
* The SLEEPn description in the datasheet actually represents physical voltage, which means we need to manually wire
it to 5V to activate the controller
